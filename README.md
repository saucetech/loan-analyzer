# loan-valuation

This project was created to automate the valuation of microlending loans.

There are 5 parts to the project.

Part 1 uses loops and variables to automate the calculations for the loan portfolio summaries. 

Part 2 uses more detailed data for one of the loans to calculate the present value (AKA fair price) of what this loan would be worth.

Part 3 places the calculation in a function so that the code can be reused at scale.

Part 4 loops through a series of loans to conditionally filter out the inexpensive loans that are worth $500 or less into a list.

Part 5 saves the data and writes it into a csv file.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.7 with no additional packages.

## Usage

To use the loan analyzer application, simply clone the repository and run the **loan_analyzer.py**

A csv file will be created with the resulting loans.
